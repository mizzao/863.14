This week's assigment, as a section, was to use the **Gestalt**
framework, consisting both [hardware](http://monograph.io/james/m-mtm)
and [software](https://github.com/imoyer/gestalt) to build a machine
that makes something. We made a proof-of-concept light painting
machine that produces pictures like the one you see below. You can
find out more about the entire process on
[our project page](../../../projects/).

I particpated along the whole process, from stuffing the initial
boards, to testing the code, to running the final tool paths. On this
page, I'd like to document some specific details of Gestalt.

## Installation on Windows

The Gestalt software came to us having only been tested on Linux. The
Mac users had their own issues getting started, but here's a checklist
for Windows users:

1. Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)---not
   Python 3.4. There are numerous differences between Python 2 and 3,
   and Gestalt has been built with Python 2. Make sure to add Python
   to your `PATH` so you can run it from a command prompt.
   
2. Install [pySerial](http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/). There are
   many ways to do this, but perhaps the most "correct" way to do it
   is to first install `pip`, the Python package manager. `pip` comes
   with Python 3.4 and later, but since we're on Python 2, we will
   have to go through a jankier process.
   
   First, download
   [this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py)
   for installing pip. (It's not a virus.) Then, run the following
   commands:
   
   ~~~
   > python get-pip.py
   > python -m pip install pyserial
   ~~~
   
   (`python -m pip` is an alias for just `pip` on Windows.)

3. Build the gestalt software. First, check out a copy of
   [the repository](https://github.com/imoyer/gestalt). Then, go to
   the directory and run

   ~~~
   > python setup.py install
   ~~~
   
   This builds the code and installs it locally so you can `import
   gestalt` from Python code. Otherwise doing this will throw an
   error, and you may be tempted to make a bunch of copies of the
   files to try and fix it, which is sure to cause more havoc.
   
4. Test! At this point you should be able to get a basic two-node,
   two-axis machine running with the provided `xy_plotter.py` demo
   file. Make sure to set the correct serial port -- it'll be `COM3`
   instead of the `/dev/ttyUSB0` that is used for Linux.
   
You can see [this file][lights] for our modifications from the
`xy_plotter.py` file, used to draw the light paintings for this week.

## Building Custom Gestalt Nodes

A little earlier in the week we entertained the idea of building a
custom gestalt node as our end effector, instead of using a separately
controlled (or in our case, uncontrolled) LED. This would have allowed
us to specify both the position and *color* of the light
"paintbrush". We decided that it was probably a little too ambitious
to do this right before the final project, but I'll document my
exploration here in case someone wants to try in the future.

The whole system is very cool, as it integrates the hardware and
control software for building machines with various actuators and
effectors. The host computer can communicate with all of the nodes
simultaneously over an RS-485 bus, and can use software to set up
different kinds of actuation. I'm personally a fan of good design in
software libraries, so it's even more impressive to see a modular
software **and** hardware system.

### Node Hardware

What would it take to build a node that controls an RGB LED with PWM?

First, check out the
[schematic and boards for the gestalt nodes](https://github.com/imoyer/086-005/tree/master/board). We
can ignore most of the circuitry for the stepper motor. However, the
following parts are necessary:

- There is an 18.432 MHz crystal used to time the ATmega328p, because
  it is an exact multiple of the 115200 baud transmission rate on the
  bus.
  
- A Texas Instruments 75176-series IC is used to interface between the
  microcontroller and the RS-485 bus.
  
At this point, we'd pretty much ruled out building a custom mode,
because the bit-banging required of a microcontroller running at a
different frequency would complicate things quite a bit, not to
mention missing the RS-485 transceiver altogether.

However, once we've connected to the RS-485 bus, controlling an RGB
LED using the PWM pins of the microcontroller is pretty easy; the
whole node would be pretty lightweight and not require the massive
TL78 regulator currently used for the stepper motors.

### Attaching to the Bus, and Software

Suppose we had the fictional node as described above; how would we
control it from software?

The gestalt software allows a **virtual machine** to be defined in
python code, corresponding to different possible physical arrangements
of the actuators. The virtual machine code for the 2-axis plotter
includes the following:

~~~
class virtualMachine(machines.virtualMachine):
    
    def initInterfaces(self):
        if self.providedInterface: self.fabnet = self.providedInterface     #providedInterface is defined in the virtualMachine class.
        else: self.fabnet = interfaces.gestaltInterface('FABNET', interfaces.serialInterface(baudRate = 115200, interfaceType = 'ftdi', portName = '/dev/ttyUSB0'))
        
    def initControllers(self):
        self.xAxisNode = nodes.networkedGestaltNode('X Axis', self.fabnet, filename = '086-005a.py', persistence = self.persistence)
        self.yAxisNode = nodes.networkedGestaltNode('Y Axis', self.fabnet, filename = '086-005a.py', persistence = self.persistence)

        self.xyNode = nodes.compoundNode(self.xAxisNode, self.yAxisNode)

    def initCoordinates(self):
        self.position = state.coordinate(['mm', 'mm'])
    
    def initKinematics(self):
        self.xAxis = elements.elementChain.forward([elements.microstep.forward(4), elements.stepper.forward(1.8), elements.leadscrew.forward(8), elements.invert.forward(True)])
        self.yAxis = elements.elementChain.forward([elements.microstep.forward(4), elements.stepper.forward(1.8), elements.leadscrew.forward(8), elements.invert.forward(False)])       
        self.stageKinematics = kinematics.direct(2) #direct drive on all axes
    
    def initFunctions(self):
        self.move = functions.move(virtualMachine = self, virtualNode = self.xyNode, axes = [self.xAxis, self.yAxis], kinematics = self.stageKinematics, machinePosition = self.position,planner = 'null')
        self.jog = functions.jog(self.move) #an incremental wrapper for the move function
        pass
    
    # ... other functions
~~~        

From what I understand, the functions serve the following purposes:

- `initInterfaces` sets up the communication between the software
  virtual machine and the serial bus.

- `initControllers` sets up software to control the two nodes for each
  axis, using the communication protocols defined in `086-005a.py`.
  
- `initCoordinates` stores the initial coordinates of the machine.

- `initKinematics` specifies the motor stepping, the number of turns
  on the leadscrew, and the screw handedness. This appears to be
  different from the code in `086-005a.py` which issues lower level
  motor commands over the bus.

- `initFunctions` specifies the operations that can be run on the
  virtual machine, which current consist of just the `move`
  operation---simultaneously moving the x and y axis nodes. There
  appears to be a stub for a `jog` function, which will presumably
  move the motors more quickly.
  
At a high level, implementing an LED node would then involve the
following steps:

1. Write low-level Python code to communicate with the node over the
   serial bus. This would allow three numbers to be sent to the node
   for PWM duty cycle, for example in 8-bit format (0 - 255).

2. Define a new node in a virtual machine using `networkedGestaltNode`
   and this file.
   
3. Define the "kinematics" for LEDs. Since LEDs will immediately
   change to their desired brightness value when instructions are
   sent, this will be much simpler than what is required for stepper
   motor control.
   
4. Define a high-level function to set the LED color (brightness of
   each component). Currently the `gestalt.functions` module only
   contains the `move` and `jog` functions---the reason for the extra
   step is to allow intermediate code to optimize the movement process
   from the high-level instructions. Most of this functionality could
   be skipped for an LED brightness control.

Although the whole system could be more robust, it's very exciting to
see the product of a fruitful marriage of hardware and software. I'm
sure the future years will be able to build even more advanced
machines.
